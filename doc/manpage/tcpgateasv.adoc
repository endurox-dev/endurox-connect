NAME
----
tcpgatesv - Enduro/X user programmable tpc gateway (client/server roles, XATMI server).

SYNOPSIS
--------
*tcpgatesv*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Use programmable tcp gateway. The server gives for programmer abstraction over the tcp
sockets. This module gives programmer abstraction over of the socket to the next level - 
XATMI services. By using tpcgateway for programmer to send network message, it is sufficient
for dong the XATMI service invocation with specific UBF buffer, containing the message to
be sent to network. The network address now is abstracted to XATMI service name. All other
details technical details of socket operations are covered by *tcpgatesv*.

The getaway is able to handle multiple simultaneous connections. The connections are identified
by connection id, which cosists of two parts - simple connection id (started from Nr. 1) and
by compiled connection id, where part of the number contains the actual timestamp when
connection is established.

Getaway can operate with persistent connections, so that tcpgatesv opens the number of
connections, and callers (from both ends XATMI and network) can do the invocations synchronously
or asynchronously. In async mode it is still possible to simulate synchronous service invocations,
that is done in case if 'corr_svc' parameter is set. This parameter indicates which
service which to invoke for sending incoming message for parsing. The correlation service
can parse the message, and respond with parsed correlation id (in 'EX_NETCORR').
Then by this given correlation ID, the gateway server will lookup any XATMI callers
in progress, if found, then they are replied with buffer coming from 'corr_svc'.
If correlation id is not parsed or no waiters in progress, then 'incoming_svc' is
called with given incoming/'corr_svc' response buffer.

Geteway can operate in one request-new connection mode from both ends, it can accept the request
from network (in this case we must be passive - wait for conn). And it can create new connection
when doing the XATMI request to network. After receiving response from network or getting timeout,
the connection is closed.

Module allows the system to track the status of the connections. When gateway boots, it
sends disconnected status to target connection tracking server ('status_svc' service in ini config).
When connection is established either in active or passive mode, the status of connection
is sent to status service.

It is possible to configure gateway to send keep-a-live messages. The keep a live message
is zero length. Thus can be safely ignored by network target device. The same as *tcpgatesv*
does.

Tcpgateway uses different message framing algorithms, to avoid partially read messages
from network, which can occur if message size is larger than message transfer unit (MTU).
Framing mode is controlled by 'framing' parameter. Following options are supported:

. a+ - ASCII formatted string message length

. A+ - ASCII formatted string with message length, including the length bytes

. ll+ - little endian byte order (from one to 8 bytes)

. LL+ - little endian byte order (from one to 8 bytes), message length includes length bytes by it self

. bb+ - big endian byte order (from one to 8 bytes)

. BB+ - big endian byte order (from one to 8 bytes), message length includes length bytes

. d - Message end delimiter byte

. D - Message start and end delimiter byte

Note that if even bytes are used for connection length indication, it is possible,
to swap them in half by using 'framing_half_swap' parameter. This is suitable
for connecting to VISA payment network, which uses little endian 4 bytes, which
are swapped in big endian order by two halves.

The administrator can configure *tcpgatesv* for different roles:

. Tcp socket server - listener (passive mode)

. Tcp socket client - connects  (active mode)

The tcpgateway can operate in different logical modes (type param):

. 'A' - Active mode, our side initiate connection (tcp client)

. 'P' - Passive mode, our side does listen on socket (tcp server)

The next sections will show samples for different framing methods, including
settings of 'framing' and 'framing_half_swap'. The test message that will be
demonstrated in bellow framing modes are: 'AHELLO WORLD\\10\\11\\12\\13TEST\\ff',
the total number of bytes: 21.

SERVICE API INTERFACE
---------------------

TCP Gateway is programmed by using UBF buffers. Buffers contains specific fields
including CARRAY (BLOB) message that needs to be delivered or is received from
network.

In case of sending data to network standard *tpcall(3)* or *tpacall(3)* are used.
The target service of invocation is configured in *gateway* parameter, that is
advertised by *tpcgatewsv*. 

When message is received from network, with incoming data, the 'corr_svc' will be
invoked if configured. Finally message is delivered to 'incoming_svc', the invocation
by tcpgatesv will be done synchronously or asynchronously depending on configuration
parameters and message specification.

*Sending message to network - request*

To send message to network in use following UBF buffer (tpcall(3)):

'EX_NETDATA' - The BLOB/CARRAY data to delivery to target connection

'EX_NETCONNID' - connection id either compiled or simple. The compiled connection
id can be used when generating response back to network. The connection id is
composed of 64bit integer, where first 24 bits are connection id, and oldest 40bits
are set to UTC epoch milliseconds since start of 1970. The compiled it can be used
for doing reply to exact connection.

'EX_NETCORR' - Optional Correlator string, used for synchronous connections.

*Response from gateway service*

'EX_NERROR_CODE' - Error code, can be one of followings:

*atmi.NEMANDATORY (6)* - Mandatory field is missing ('EX_NETDATA')

*atmi.NETOUT (8)* - timeout waiting on reply

*atmi.NENOCONN (9)* - Connection not found by 'EX_NETCONNID' or no connection established.

*atmi.NELIMIT (10)* - Connection count limit reached

'EX_NERROR_MSG' - Corresponding error message.


*A. tpreturn(3) buffer to async service reply - example*

Request/reply example (from client perspective - in this example server process
does change the data bytes doing +1 over the data starting from position 5):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ud < test.ud
SENT pkt(1) is :
EX_NETCONNID	1
EX_NETCORR	AELL
EX_NETDATA	AELLO WORLD\00\10\11\12\13TEST\ff

RTN pkt(1) is :
EX_NERROR_CODE	0
EX_NETCONNID	6481138401960525826
EX_NERROR_MSG	SUCCEED
EX_NETGATEWAY	TCP_P_ASYNC_P
EX_NETCORR	AELL
EX_NETDATA	AELLP!XPSME\01\11\12\13\14UFTU\00
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Incoming request at correlation service (other end reads network and sends data to
('corr_svc'), at the destination with no reply waiter, it will just invoke the
incoming service (see after this dump).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EX_NETCONNID    6481138401943748609
EX_NETGATEWAY   TCP_P_ASYNC_A
EX_NETDATA      AELLO WORLD\00\10\11\12\13TEST\ff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incoming request at server ('incoming_svc'):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EX_NETCONNID    6481138401943748609
EX_NETGATEWAY   TCP_P_ASYNC_A
EX_NETCORR      AELL
EX_NETDATA      AELLO WORLD\00\10\11\12\13TEST\ff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that when message is received back from other host, it is sent for 
correlation service so that we can match the response. For this particular case
the invocation did look like:

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The configuration is written in CCONFIG ini file. The section for 
tcp gateway is *[@tcpgate/CCTAG]*. The *CCTAG* is optional. Following
parameters are available for tcp gateway:

*gencore* = 'GENERATE_OS_CORE_DUMPS'::
If set to *1*, for signals 6 (abort), 11 (segmentation fault) default
Operating System handlers will be restored instead of go handlers. This
can be suitable when debugging cgo code.
Default is *0*.

*workers_out* = 'NUMBER_OF_XATMI_SESSIONS_FOR_OUTGOING_MESSAGES'::
Number of worker sessions for dispatching message to network on doing reply back
to XATMI service caller. This basically is how many go threads will process the
incoming requests. If system is short of the threads, the main XATMI thread waiting
for incoming messages, will be suspended on waiting the free worker.
In case of 'req_reply' mode *3* (XATMI service sends to network by opening new 
connection and then closing), the 'workers_out' must be bigger or equal number
to 'max_connections'. The recommendation is to use 'max_connections' = 'workers_out'\*2
for this scenario.
Default is *5*.

*workers_in* = 'NUMBER_OF_XATMI_SESSIONS_FOR_INCOMING_MESSAGES'::
Number of XATMI and go thread workers processing the incoming messages. The pool
of worker is used in case when connection receives data from network. The workers
are used for invocation of 'incoming_svc'.
Default is *5*.

*gateway* = 'TCP_GATEWAY_SERVICE_NAME'::
Gateway service name. This is service name which is advertised by the *tcpgatesv*
for accessing the outgoing message facility.
Default is *TCPGATE*.

*framing* = 'FRAMING_MODE'::
Framing mode code. This tells in what format message length is encoded.
Described above. Shortly:

'l+' - little endian byte order, does not include length of it self

'L+' - little endian byte order, include length of it self

'b+' - big endian byte order, does not include length of it self

'B+' - big endian byte order, include length of it self

'a+' - ASCII text byte order, does not include length by it self

'A+' - ASCII text byte order, does include length by it self

'd' - Use message stop indicator (set by 'delim_start')

'D' - Use message start & stop indicators (set by 'delim_stop')

*framing_half_swap* = 'SWAP_FRAMING_BYTES::
If set to *1*, framing length bytes will be swapped in middle.
The framing bytes length must be even
length. This affects l,L,b,B,a,A formats. This is suitable for connecting
for payment networks like VISA Net. For example if we use format llll, and
the message length in decimal is 217321, then in hex it will be
0x00,0x03,0x50,0xe9 by applying this parameter, the bytes that will be
sent to network will be in following order: 0x50,0xe9,0x00,0x03.
Default is *0*

*max_msg_len* = 'MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH::
If set above *0*, then parameter indicates 
max message length. This does not include framing bytes. If the incoming
message goes over this number, the message is dropped and connection is restarted,
because there might be error in framing byte readings by corrupted data.
The default is *0*.

*delim_start* = 'MESSAGE_START_DELIMITER::
If using framing format *D*, the this paramter indicates the start
of the incoming message. This basically is extra field which is tested
when message is received. If the start of the message does not match
the delimiter, the message is dropped and connection restarted. The
syntac for the field is in hex format byte, e.g. "0x02".
The default is *0x02* STX symbol.

*delim_stop* = 'MESSAGE_STOP_DELIMITER::
If using framing format *d* or *D* this byte will indicate the message
terminator symbol. The syntax for the field is in hex for .e.g "0x03".
The default value is *0x03* ETX symbol.

*type* = 'ACTIVE_PASSIVE_MODE'::
Gateway operation mode either it is passive (*P*) - waiting for incoming
TCP connection, or it is active (*A*) - tcp client doing connection to
network. In Case of active mode, it will try to open connections to network.
If configured for persistent connections, then gateway will try to keep
the max number of connections open. In case of passive mode, it will
accept the max number of connections, set by 'max_connections' parameter.
The default is *P* - Passive.

*ip* = 'IP_ADDRESS'::
In case of active mode ('type' = *A*), this is ip address to connect
to remote server. In case of passive mode ('type' = *P*), this indicates
the binding ip address - on which *tcpgatesv* binary shall listen for
incoming connections.
The default is *0.0.0.0*.

*port* = 'TPC_PORT_NUMBER'::
In case of active mode ('type' = *A*), this is port number to connect to.
In case of passive mode ('type' = *P*), this is port number to listen
on for incoming connections.
The default is *7921*.

*incoming_svc* = 'INCOMING_XATMI_SERVICE'::
Incoming service name to call when there is incoming message, that does not
correspond to any caller waiting for answer. This is incoming message for
which there is no correlation id (the 'corr_svc' is not set or 'corr_svc'
service did not return 'EX_NETCORR' field.

*periodic_zero_msg* = 'PERIODIC_ZERO'::
Number of seconds after which send to network zero length message for keeping
connection alive. Used if number is greater that zero. Parameter is not
suitable for non-persistent connections. I.e. it is not possible to use
this paramter with 'req_reply' modes *3* and *4*.
The default is *0*.

*status_svc* = 'STATUS_SERVICE_NAME'::
Name of the service which receives connection status updates. Parameter
is optional, and if not set, then connection status updates will not be
issued.

*max_connections* = 'MAX_NR_OF_CONNECTIONS'::
Max number of simulatnious connections supported by gateway. In case of
active mode and using persistent connections, this is the number of connects
gateway will try to keep open (reconnect if needed). In case of non-persistent
mode (ex-to-net, 'req_reply'=*3*), the 'max_connections' must be greater
than 'workers_out'. Recommended is 'max_connections' twice as 'workers_out'.
In case of passive mode, this is max number of open incoming connections. If the
incoming connections gets bigger number that this, the incoming connection will
be closed.
The default is *5*.


*req_reply* = 'REQUEST_MODE'::
Request reply mode. This basically tells the *tcpgatesv* role and the mode
in which gateway will operate. Following modes are defined: 

*0* - Persistent connection mode, asynchronous messages, including sync with correlation.
Supported connection 'type' active (*A*) and passive (*P*). In active mode
gateway will try to establish the max number of connections. In passive mode
gateway waits for max number of incoming connections.

When XATMI client invokes the gateway service, the service waits for outgoing 
('workers_out') XATMI context object. If object is acquired, the message is submitted
to free network connection thread for further processing. If the connection id is specified
by 'EX_NETCONNID', then connection is searched, if not found reject is generated,
if found the message is enqueued. At this point response is generated and send
back to caller either success (message sent to network thread) or error.

When message is received from network, and correlator service 'corr_svc' returns
'EX_NETCORR' field, then reply waiter (XATMI request object waiting for reply) is
located, if found, then reply is passed back to caller. If reply is not found or
'EX_NETCORR' does not exists in UBF buffer, then incoming message is passed to
'incoming_svc'. The invocation is done with 'tpacall(3)', *TPNOREPLY* mode. Meaning
that no answer is waited back from target server back to *tcpgatesv*.

In correlated connections, the time-out waiting on network is determined by 
'req_reply_timeout' parameter in seconds.

*1* - Persistent, sync by connection, Enduro/X sends to Network. No matter of the role
from active or passive (both are supported in this mode). The connection will be opened
as in 'req_reply' mode *0* (above). But the difference is that each invocation will
be done in synchronous way, meaning that for each connection only one request can
be be sent at the same time. When the response is received from network, the waiter
is looked up by connection id. If waiter is found then answer is delivered to waiter
with 'tpreturn(3)'. If waiter is not found, then target service 'incoming_svc'
is called in asynchronous way with out waiting a reply. This can be suitable for
cases to detect any late response messages. The service name can be set to dummy
one. If service invocation generates error, it will be logged in logfile and connection
will continue to serve.

In correlated connections, the time-out waiting on network is determined by 
'req_reply_timeout' parameter in seconds.

*2* - Persistent, sync by connection, Network sends to Enduro/X. The role of 
connection type active or passive does not matter here. The connection establishment
will be done according to 'req_reply' mode *0* and *1*. In this mode, connection
receives request it waits for free 'workers_in' XATMI object. Once incoming object
is got, the service 'incoming_svc' is invoked with *tpcall(3)*. If response is received
and 'EX_NETDATA' is present, the answer is sent to network back. If service call
did succeed, but 'EX_NETDATA' is not present, connection is restarted. If service
invocation did not succeed, the call is ignored. The timeout for service invocation
is standard XATMI timeout flag ('NDRX_TOUT' environment or '[@global]' section
parameter).

*3* - Non-persistent, sync each request - new connection, Enduro/X sends to Net.
In this mode for each of the requests, new connection is created. Once response
is received, connection is closed. For this mode, 'type' must be *A* - active,
in order to establish a connection.

The time-out waiting on network is determined by 'req_reply_timeout'
parameter in seconds.

*4* - In this mode Enduro/X receives connection from network and invokes target
service 'incoming_svc'. The invocation is done with *tpcall(3)*. If call does 
not succeed, the  error is ignored. If call succeeds but 'EX_NETDATA' is not present
connection is closed. If call did succeed and 'EX_NETDATA' is present, the response
message is prepared and sent back to network and then connection is closed.

The 'incoming_svc' service invocation timeout is governed by 'NDRX_TOUT' parameter.

In this mode the gateway must be configured in passive mode (waiting for connection),
i.e. 'type'=*P*.

*req_reply_timeout* = 'REQUEST_TIMEOUT'::
Request time-out in seconds. This parameter is used for monitoring outgoing connection's
synchronous messaging. When the incoming requester did *tpcall(3)* of
the advertised 'gateway' service, and the 'EX_NETCORR' was present or the connection
mode was *1* or *3*. The calls are put in waiter lists. Gateway periodically scans
the connection waiter lists (period is set by 'scan_time' parameter). If the reply
time is reached with no response, the caller will get back UBF response with 
'EX_NERROR_CODE'=*8* (timeout).

The default is *60* seconds.


*scan_time* = 'SCAN_TIME'::
The number of seconds where main Enduro/X dispatcher thread is interrupted in order
to run time-out scans. For outgoing correlated connections (either by correlator id
or by connection).

The default is *1* - every second.


*conn_wait_time* = 'CONNECTION_WAIT_TIME'::
This is time-out time in seconds waiting for connection from connection pool (when
connection is not identified by 'EX_NETCONNID'. The parameter is effective only form
'req_reply' modes *0* and *1*. In case if timeout is reached, the error *NENOCONN*
error *9* will be generated.

The default is *60* seconds.


*corr_svc* = 'CORRELATION_SERVICE'::
Correlation service to invoke for incoming requests. This parameter is optional.
The correlation service will not be used in parameter is not. The service is must
have in order to work in 'req_reply' mode *0* and have synchronous connections,
because of missing correlation service, the gateway will be unable to find the
reply waiter object. For other connection 'req_reply' modes this is informative
service that can populate the 'EX_NETCORR' for incoming messages. *NOTE* that
'corr_svc' have a rights to change the 'EX_NETDATA' in reply so that when request
or reply is coming in from network, the already parsed data can be delivered to
'incoming_svc'.

The default value for this field is *unset* (i.e. empty parameter - not used).

*debug* = 'DEBUG_STRING'::
Enduro/X standard debug string, see *ndrxdebug.conf(5)* manpage. The sample value
could look like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[@tcpgate]
...
debug=ndrx=5 ubf=0 tp=5 file=/tmp/tcpgatesv.log

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meaning that Enduro/X internal ATMI level logging ('ndrx' setting) is set to 5 - 
debug, and user logging 'tp' (*tcpgatesv* binary) logging also is set to 5 - debug.
Output file will be set to '/tmp/tcpgatesv.log'. UBF logging is set to none.
